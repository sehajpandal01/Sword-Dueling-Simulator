A sword dueling game I plan on making in the future using C++ and Unreal Engine, but currently just scripting out ideas and general strucutre using Python and Pygame.

Current Progress: Created a basic framework to add onto using C++, looking to see what components are needed to seamlessly integrate with Unreal Engine. I've been able to add a health bar, xp and leveling system, and a third person pov as the main fighting scene for the game. It also now has realistic sound effects that give the feeling of an actual sword fight.
